# Run

All ralph run documents can be found in `$run_path/{logs,sandbox,backlog.md,current.md,done.md}`

## Instructions

0a. Familiarize yourself with all code relevant to the plan or review
0b. Familiarize yourself with the project `AGENTS.md`

We're working on implementing the spec plan in `$spec_path`

## Notes

- This `.ralph` directory is a separately git tracked repo with the main project.
- All `./` paths are relative to the file they appear (ex: `./logs` in `.ralph/.template/ralph.md` would be `.ralph/.template/logs`) otherwise they are relative to the project root.
- Use the `./sandbox/` directory as a scratchpad for your work (prefix with `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>` for clarity). Store long term plans, notes, helper scripts and todo lists there.
