Please help me test the Claude event formatting by providing a comprehensive response that includes:

1. **Text with markdown formatting** including:

   - Headers (# ## ###)
   - Bold and italic text (**bold** _italic_)
   - Code blocks ```javascript and inline `code`
   - Lists and bullet points
   - Links [text](url) and blockquotes

2. **Tool usage** - please use available tools like:

   - File search/listing commands
   - Any bash commands
   - Text editing or analysis tools

3. **Thinking sections** - show your reasoning process

4. **Multiple content blocks** - mix text, tool use, and thinking

5. **Error handling** - if any tools fail, that's actually helpful for testing

Please make this a realistic and comprehensive response that would exercise all the formatting capabilities. The goal is to test how well the Claude response formatting system handles various event types and content blocks.

This is for testing the Ralph CLI tool's Claude response formatting system.
