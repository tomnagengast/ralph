Please demonstrate extensive tool usage to test tool event formatting. Try to:

1. **Chain multiple tools together** - use one tool's output as input for another
2. **Use parallel tools** - if possible, initiate multiple tool calls
3. **Mix different tool types** - bash commands, file operations, searches, etc.
4. **Show tool results processing** - analyze and summarize tool outputs
5. **Handle tool failures gracefully** - if some tools fail, continue with others

Specific tools to try:

- File system operations (ls, find, cat, etc.)
- Text processing (grep, sort, etc.)
- Any analysis or processing tools available
- Network operations if available

The goal is to generate many different tool use events, tool result events, and mixed content to test the comprehensive tool formatting in Ralph CLI.

This is for testing tool event formatting specifically.
