Let's update the current interface to run behind a -p or --prompt flag.
Then I also want to add an `init` command which creates the defaults if they don't already exist:

- `specs/backlog` dir
- `specs/done` dir
- `specs/active` dir
- `ralph.toml` empty file
- `plan.md` empty file
- `prompt.md` empty file
- `CLAUDE.md` empty file

So we should have the following:

- `ralph -p "Paint a fence"` starts a ralph loop
- `ralph init`: creates the files used for running ralph
